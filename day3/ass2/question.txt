Assignment 2: Counter

Title: Counter Assignment

Instructions:
1. Create an HTML document with a title element.
2. Add a heading (e.g., `<h1>Click the button to increase the count!</h1>`) to explain the assignment's purpose.
3. Create a button element (e.g., `<button id="counterButton">Click Me</button>`) to serve as the trigger for counting.
4. Add a paragraph element (e.g., `<p>Count: <span id="count">0</span></p>`) to display the current count value.
5. Write a JavaScript variable called `count` and set its initial value to 0.
6. Write a JavaScript function called `updateCounter()` that increments the `count` variable by 1 and updates the text content of the `<span>` element to display the new count value.
7. Add an onclick event to the button (with the id "counterButton") that calls the `updateCounter()` function whenever the button is clicked.
8. Test the assignment by opening the HTML document in a web browser. Verify that clicking the button increases the count displayed on the page.
