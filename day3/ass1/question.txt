Assignment 1: Change Background Color

Title: Change Background Color Assignment

Instructions:
1. Create an HTML document with a title element.
2. Add a heading (e.g., `<h1>Click anywhere on the page to change the background color!</h1>`) to explain the assignment's purpose.
3. Write a JavaScript function called `getRandomColor()` that generates a random color.
4. Write another JavaScript function called `changeBackgroundColor()` that sets the background color of the document's body to the random color obtained from `getRandomColor()`.
5. Add an onclick event to the entire document that calls the `changeBackgroundColor()` function whenever the user clicks anywhere on the page.
6. Test the assignment by opening the HTML document in a web browser. Verify that clicking anywhere on the page changes the background color.
